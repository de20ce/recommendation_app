# Module 6: Evaluation and Metrics for Recommendation Systems

---

## Slide 1: Introduction to Evaluation in Recommendation Systems

### Why is Evaluation Important?

- **Assess Performance**: Evaluation helps determine how well a recommendation system is performing in terms of accuracy, relevance, and user satisfaction.
- **Improve Algorithms**: By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of a model, you can make informed decisions to improve it.
- **Ensure User Satisfaction**: High-quality recommendations lead to better user experiences, increased engagement, and higher retention rates.

### Key Concepts

- **Offline vs. Online Evaluation**: Different methods for evaluating recommendation systems.
- **Metrics**: Various quantitative measures to assess the effectiveness of a recommender.

**Citations**:
- "Evaluation is crucial for the iterative improvement of recommendation systems, ensuring they meet user needs and business goals." [Herlocker et al., 2004]

## Slide 2: Accuracy Metrics

### Precision and Recall

- **Precision**:
  - Measures the proportion of recommended items that are relevant.
  - \[
  \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{Number of Relevant Items Recommended}}{\text{Total Number of Items Recommended}}
  \]
  - High precision means fewer irrelevant items are recommended.

- **Recall**:
  - Measures the proportion of relevant items that are recommended.
  - \[
  \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{Number of Relevant Items Recommended}}{\text{Total Number of Relevant Items}}
  \]
  - High recall means most of the relevant items are recommended.

### F1-Score

- **F1-Score**: 
  - Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
  - \[
  \text{F1-Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
  \]
  - Provides a balance between precision and recall.

**Citations**:
- "Precision and recall are fundamental metrics for evaluating recommendation systems, particularly when relevance is a key factor." [Manning et al., 2008]

## Slide 3: Rank-Based Metrics

### Mean Average Precision (MAP)

- **Mean Average Precision (MAP)**:
  - Computes the average precision across multiple queries.
  - Useful in ranking scenarios where the order of recommendations matters.
  - \[
  \text{MAP} = \frac{1}{Q} \sum_{q=1}^{Q} \text{Average Precision}(q)
  \]
  - Where \( Q \) is the number of queries.

### Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG)

- **NDCG**:
  - Measures the usefulness of a recommendation based on its position in the ranking.
  - Rewards relevant items that appear earlier in the list.
  - \[
  \text{NDCG} = \frac{DCG}{IDCG}
  \]
  - Where \( DCG \) is the discounted cumulative gain and \( IDCG \) is the ideal DCG.

### Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)

- **MRR**:
  - Calculates the average of reciprocal ranks of the first relevant item.
  - \[
  \text{MRR} = \frac{1}{Q} \sum_{i=1}^{Q} \frac{1}{\text{rank}_i}
  \]
  - Focuses on the rank of the first relevant item.

**Citations**:
- "Rank-based metrics like NDCG and MAP are essential for evaluating systems where the order of recommendations significantly impacts user satisfaction." [Jarvelin and Kekalainen, 2002]

## Slide 4: Diversity and Novelty Metrics

### Diversity

- **Diversity**:
  - Measures how different the recommended items are from each other.
  - Ensures that the recommendation list covers a broad spectrum of user interests.
  - **Intra-List Diversity**: Calculated by measuring the pairwise dissimilarity between recommended items.

### Novelty

- **Novelty**:
  - Refers to the ability of the system to recommend items that the user has not seen before.
  - Encourages the discovery of new and unique content.
  - **Serendipity**: A related concept that captures how surprising and delightful the recommendations are to the user.

### Implementation Example in Python

```python
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np

def intra_list_diversity(recommendations, item_features):
    similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(item_features)
    n = len(recommendations)
    diversity = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            diversity += (1 - similarity_matrix[recommendations[i], recommendations[j]])
    return diversity / (n * (n - 1) / 2)

# Example usage
recommendations = [0, 1, 2]  # Indices of recommended items
item_features = np.array([[0, 1], [1, 0], [0.5, 0.5]])  # Sample feature vectors
diversity_score = intra_list_diversity(recommendations, item_features)
print(f"Intra-List Diversity: {diversity_score}")
```

**Citations**:
- "Incorporating diversity and novelty into recommendation systems is crucial for enhancing user experience by introducing variety and reducing redundancy." [Vargas and Castells, 2011]

## Slide 5: Offline vs. Online Evaluation

### Offline Evaluation

- **Concept**:
  - Uses historical data to simulate user interactions and assess the recommendation system's performance.
  - **Advantages**: Fast and repeatable, can be done without affecting real users.
  - **Limitations**: May not fully capture real-world user behavior.

### Online Evaluation

- **Concept**:
  - Involves deploying the recommendation system in a live environment and collecting feedback from actual user interactions.
  - **Methods**: A/B testing, multivariate testing.
  - **Advantages**: Provides real-world performance data.
  - **Limitations**: Time-consuming and can impact user experience if not done carefully.

### A/B Testing Example

- **A/B Testing**:
  - Split users into two groups: one sees recommendations from the current system (control group), and the other sees recommendations from the new system (test group).
  - Compare key metrics (e.g., click-through rate, conversion rate) between the two groups.

**Citations**:
- "While offline evaluation is useful for initial testing, online evaluation through methods like A/B testing provides the most accurate measure of a recommendation system's effectiveness." [Kohavi et al., 2009]

## Slide 6: Practical Evaluation and Case Study

### Implementing Evaluation Metrics in Python

- **Example: Evaluating a Recommender System**:

```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score, recall_score

# Example true and predicted labels
true_labels = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0]
predicted_labels = [1, 0, 1, 0, 0]

# Calculate precision and recall
precision = precision_score(true_labels, predicted_labels)
recall = recall_score(true_labels, predicted_labels)

print(f"Precision: {precision}")
print(f"Recall: {recall}")
```

### Case Study: Evaluating a Movie Recommendation System

- **Scenario**:
  - A streaming service wants to improve its recommendation system.
  - **Metrics Used**: Precision, recall, NDCG, intra-list diversity.
  - **Evaluation Process**:
    - **Offline**: Use historical user interaction data to simulate recommendations and calculate metrics.
    - **Online**: Conduct A/B testing with a subset of users to measure the impact of the new recommendation algorithm.

**Results**:
- **Improvements**: The new system showed a 15% increase in NDCG and a 20% increase in intra-list diversity, leading to higher user satisfaction and engagement.

**Citations**:
- "A combination of offline and online evaluation methods provides a comprehensive understanding of a recommendation system's performance." [Gunawardana and Shani, 2009]
