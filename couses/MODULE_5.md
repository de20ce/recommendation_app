## Slide 2: Deep Learning for Recommendations

### Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)

- **Concept**: Uses neural networks to model user-item interactions.
- **Architecture**: Combines user and item embeddings with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to predict interactions.
- **Advantages**: Captures non-linear relationships and complex interactions.

### Implementation in Python

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Embedding, Flatten, Concatenate, Dense

# Define input layers
user_input = Input(shape=(1,), name='user_input')
item_input = Input(shape=(1,), name='item_input')

# Embedding layers
user_embedding = Embedding(input_dim=num_users, output_dim=embedding_dim)(user_input)
item_embedding = Embedding(input_dim=num_items, output_dim=embedding_dim)(item_input)

# Flatten embeddings
user_vecs = Flatten()(user_embedding)
item_vecs = Flatten()(item_embedding)

# Concatenate user and item vectors
input_vecs = Concatenate()([user_vecs, item_vecs])

# Add dense layers
x = Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_vecs)
x = Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
output = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(x)

# Build and compile model
model = Model([user_input, item_input], output)
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy')
```

## Slide 3: Autoencoders for Collaborative Filtering

### Concept and Application

- **Autoencoders**: Neural networks designed to learn efficient representations (encodings) of data.
- **Use in Collaborative Filtering**: Learn user-item interaction patterns to predict missing ratings.

### Implementation in Python

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Input, Dense

# Define input layer
input_ratings = Input(shape=(num_items,), name='input_ratings')

# Encoding layers
encoded = Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_ratings)
encoded = Dense(64, activation='relu')(encoded)

# Decoding layers
decoded = Dense(128, activation='relu')(encoded)
decoded = Dense(num_items, activation='sigmoid')(decoded)

# Build and compile model
autoencoder = Model(input_ratings, decoded)
autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model
autoencoder.fit(user_item_matrix, user_item_matrix, epochs=50, batch_size=256, shuffle=True)
```

**Citations**:
- "Autoencoders offer a powerful approach to collaborative filtering by learning latent user-item interactions in an unsupervised manner." [Sedhain et al., 2015]

## Slide 4: Graph-Based Recommendation Systems

### Introduction to Graph-Based Methods

- **Graph Theory**: Utilizes graph structures to model relationships between entities (e.g., users and items).
- **Graph-Based Collaborative Filtering**: Represents users and items as nodes in a graph, with edges indicating interactions.

### Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)

- **Concept**: GNNs extend neural networks to graph-structured data.
- **Applications**: Capture complex relationships and dependencies in user-item interactions.

### Implementation Example

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
from torch_geometric.nn import GCNConv

class GNNRecommender(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_users, num_items, embedding_dim):
        super(GNNRecommender, self).__init__()
        self.user_embedding = nn.Embedding(num_users, embedding_dim)
        self.item_embedding = nn.Embedding(num_items, embedding_dim)
        self.conv1 = GCNConv(embedding_dim, 64)
        self.conv2 = GCNConv(64, 32)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(32, 1)

    def forward(self, user, item, edge_index):
        user_emb = self.user_embedding(user)
        item_emb = self.item_embedding(item)
        x = tor```

        x = self.conv1(x, edge_index)
        x = self.conv2(x, edge_index)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return torch.sigmoid(x)

# Initialize and train the model (example)
model = GNNRecommender(num_users, num_items, embedding_dim=16)
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
criterion = nn.BCELoss()

# Example training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    model.train()
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    output = model(user_tensor, item_tensor, edge_index_tensor)
    loss = criterion(output, label_tensor)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

## Slide 5: Context-Aware and Sequence-Aware Recommendations

### Context-Aware Recommendations

- **Concept**: Incorporates contextual information (e.g., time, location, device) into the recommendation process.
- **Benefits**: Provides more relevant and personalized recommendations by considering the user's current context.

### Sequence-Aware Recommendations

- **Concept**: Utilizes sequential patterns in user behavior to predict the next item a user might interact with.
- **Techniques**: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Transformers.

### Implementation Example: RNN for Sequence-Aware Recommendations

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Embedding

# Define the RNN model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Embedding(input_dim=num_items, output_dim=50, input_length=sequence_length))
model.add(LSTM(100, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(num_items, activation='softmax'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model (example)
model.fit(sequences, next_items, epochs=10, batch_size=128)
```
