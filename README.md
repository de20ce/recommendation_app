Recommendation System App
-------------------------

This project was undertaken during EEIA 2024, a summer school organized by *La Fondation Vallet*, *Benin Excellence*, and the *UNDP* in Benin. The EEIA spans four weeks: the first three weeks are dedicated to classes, practical work, and lectures, while the fourth week is reserved for projects. EEIA projects focus on developing practical solutions to computing problems using AI, particularly machine learning. The goal is to empower students to create their own AI solutions, leveraging the knowledge and skills acquired during the initial three weeks. 
The project we are sharing here involves creating a recommendation system app for online shopping/librairy book client. 

The project was managed by the following people:
> - [Tanguy **Nobime**](https://github.com/adonislab)  as the main teacher and project manager.
> -  as the associate teacher and project manager.
> - [Roger **Nouhoeflin**](https://github.com/rudigerroger) as the lead developer, associate teacher and project manager.
> - [Vincent **Whannou de Dravo**](https://github.com/de20ce) as the technical lead and project manager.

Other people involved indirectly into the project (discussion and ideation phase mostly):
